This is project #2 from the udacity android nano degree program. 

Some notes: 

* Starting with the android studio default empty template. I went with a min sdk level of 
19 because I want to be able to use Java 7 features (try with resources). 

* The main activity will be a single fragment hosting a RecyclerView with a GridLayoutManager. 

* I think I'd prefer to do the networking myself with an AsyncTask, but udacity is pushing
picasso for fetching images for this project. I'll go that way as a path of least resistance.
